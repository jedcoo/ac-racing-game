// Project Description
This group project took part during our 4th week @ <Academia de CÃ³digo_> #82 Bootcamp in Porto. The challenge was to make a game from scratch using nothing but the skills we had acquired the previous weeks. We were given 9 days to deliver a playable game to the best of our abilities.

//How to Play
This is a game in which you control a car that must dodge obstacles that appear in its direction.
The game is very simple to play. You can control the car using the arrow keys. Press the left arrow to move the car to the left, the right arrow to move the car to the right, and the up arrow to accelerate. When you encounter an obstacle, try to dodge it by moving the car to the left or right.

//Development
The first part was writing the pseudocode that would guide the project taking into account all the features our game would need. We implemented our ideas one at a time working on movement, collision, graphic elements and user interface on a pair programming regime. Necessary adjustment were made during the debugging phase.

// Tech && Methodologies
Java 7, OOP, IntelliJ IDEA, SimpleGFX Library, Adobe Photoshop, Git, Apache Ant
