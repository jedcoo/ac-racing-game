// Project Description This group project took part during our 4th week @ <Academia de CÃ³digo_> #82 Bootcamp in Porto. The challenge was to make a game from scratch using nothing but the skills we had acquired the previous weeks. We were given 9 days to deliver a playable game to the best of our abilities.

//The Idea After a couple days pondering which of our ideas would be better implemented, we settled for a two player game, reminiscent of the classic arcade game "Pong". In our iteration of the game, one would go against another and have five chances to score and win the game. Each ball, representing a chance to score, had a picture of our as a way to paying homage and as a token of our appreciation.

//Development The first part was writing the pseudocode that would guide the project taking into account all the features our game would need. We implemented our ideas one at a time working on movement, collision, graphic elements and user interface on a pair programming regime. Necessary adjustment were made during the debugging phase.

// Tech && Methodologies Java 7, OOP, IntelliJ IDEA, SimpleGFX Library, Adobe Photoshop, Git, Apache Ant
